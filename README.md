I created the Wordpress Theme based on html&css and js template from internet

It's the project where i used a big persent of my knowlege of Wordpress theme development. Also there is one of the first my tries to make a theme. In developing this theme i often visit sites that help me to make some things. 

Here i used such skills:
- linked on other files (get template part)
- display posts
- pagination
- custom types of posts (register post types) and logic "if else" on files
- custom taxonomies for custom types of posts

- many theme supports functions (logo, setting image size, menu...)
- Breadcrumbs code isn't mine (i also can make my own)
